# Personal Site
## Description

This is my Web Page development scaffolding tool, specifically used for my site: [http://jeremyeferrer.info](http://jeremyeferrer.info).

I used my [web-starer](https://github.com/jeremyef/web-starter) boilerplate as a base to begin with and worked from there.

# Quick Start
1. Clone this repo
3. Navigate to the directory and run:

  ```
   npm start
  ```
4. Run the *default* Gulp task:

  ```
  gulp default
  ```
5. Start working from the */app* directory
